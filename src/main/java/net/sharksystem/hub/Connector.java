/**
 * A connector reacts on received hub connector protocol data units (PDUs). There are two side:
 * hub and peer side. A peer registers with a peer but only unregisters by closing the connection.
 * <br/><br/>
 * A peer retrieves a set of registered peers on the hub by sending a status request. The hub will reply with
 * a status reply.
 * <br/><br/>
 * A peer ask for a connection to another peer by sending a connection request. The hub will try to initiate
 * a data connection to this peer. This attempt can take an unexpected period of time an can fail at all.
 * There are not actions required on peer side.
 * <br/><br/>
 * The hub initiates a data connection. The behaviour is different on a shared an non-shared channel.
 * We talk about a <i>shared channel</i> if the end-to-end data exchange between two peers uses the same
 * stream pair as the connector protocol.
 * <br/><br/>
 * <b>On a shared channel</b>, both connector engines must cease communication before launching a data connection. Both side must re-start
 * their work after data connection ended. This process is negotiated in some steps:
 * <br/>
 * <sl>
 *     <li>Hub send a silent request to the peer. Peer connect shall stop issuing PDUs to the hub.</li>
 *     <li>Peer side sends a silent response with a duration. It will not send any data during this period of time</li>
 *     <li>The hub sends a channel clear pdu as very last message with a time out duration.</li>
 *     <li>Both side will re-launch their connectors if no data are sent over the channel within that duration.</li>
 * </sl>
